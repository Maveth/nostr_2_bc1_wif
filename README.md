# nostr_2_bc1_wif
Python Code to convert any public key to a bc1 address, or private key to wif wallet. with nostr npub-nsec
This is provided as is, it works for me
You may have to install some dependancies

You can use either a pub hexkey or a npub key from nostr to get a bc1 bitcoin address
This should be the same address you get when you use your private key
the private key will also print the legacy addresses

confirm it all works first, but it should
Might update later
